# Description

The idea of this repo is to create a web app where you can scan a Sudoku puzzle
from a newspaper or similar, then solve the puzzle and display the solution.

At the moment, I am just solving a hard-coded puzzle and showing the solution.
My plan is to use [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to train a model
to recognise a Sudoku puzzle from a video capture. I'll probably use a separate
project to experiment with this idea and then fold the results back into this repo.
